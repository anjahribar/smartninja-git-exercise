From the readme

### To complete the challenge, you can:

- use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (although, you can also use some other CSS framework or none at all),
- use **different** images, icons and logos than the ones in the website design above (but make sure that you follow the design structure, shapes and colors).

### Where can I find free stock images:

- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- [MaxPixel](https://www.maxpixel.net/)
- [PicJumbo](https://picjumbo.com/)

You can use [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com) to easily edit images if needed.

### For icons and illustrations I recommend the following:

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) (icons)
- [UnDraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations) (illustrations)
